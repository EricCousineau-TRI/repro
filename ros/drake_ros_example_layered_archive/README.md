**Note**: Consider using [`ros2_local_repository`](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake-ros/blob/06dc6aa7d0237f4edb74130bcce8e9e78689d50c/bazel_ros2_rules/ros2/defs.bzl#L221-L239)
with your own workspace(s) for rapid prototyping / deployment equivalent to
consumption from other environments.

This is code partially exported from TRI Anzu codebase, with no revealing
