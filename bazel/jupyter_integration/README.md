# Bazel-Jupyter Stuff

See [tools/jupyter README](./tools/jupyter/README.md) for usage and examples.

## Setup

Ensure that you have Jupyter installed, and optionally Jupyter Lab.

If just using Jupyter on Ubuntu 18.04:

    sudo apt install jupyter-notebook

For Jupyter Lab, PIP is probably the easiest way.
