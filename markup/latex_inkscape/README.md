# Latex + Inkscape

I always forget a good workflow to do this. Capturing for myself, and to ask
for better workflows.

## Prereqs

Only tested on Ubuntu 18.04

```sh
sudo apt install \
    inkscape \
    texstudio \
    texlive-latex-recommended texlive-pictures texlive-latex-extra
```

## Running

Just clone, go to this folder, then open:

```sh
texstudio ./main.tex
```
